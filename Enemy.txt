THEY SAY PRAY IT AWAY
I SWEAR, THAT I'LL NEVER BE A SAINT, NO WAY
A CHAIR IN THE CORNER IS MY PLACE I STAY
I SHAKE AND I THINK ABOUT THE POWERS AT PLAY, THE POWERS AT PLAY
AND THE KIDS IN THE DARK THAT WERE DOOMED FROM THE START
THE CHILD IN THE BASEMENT, FACE TO THE PAVEMENT
OH, WHAT A STATEMENT, LOVE IS EMBRACEMENT
LOVE IS A CONSTANT, LOVE IS A BASIS
HE CANNOT BE, SHE CANNOT BE, THEY CANNOT BE CHANGED
KEEP ON PRAYING
GOODBYE
OH THE MISERY, EVERYBODY WANTS TO BE MY ENEMY
