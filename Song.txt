I WAKE UP TO THE SOUNDS
OF THE SILENCE THAT ALLOWS
FOR MY MIND TO RUN AROUND
WITH MY EAR UP TO THE GROUND

I'M SEARCHING TO BEHOLD
THE STORIES THAT ARE TOLD
WHEN MY BACK IS TO THE WORLD
THAT WAS SMILING WHEN I TURNED

TELL YOU YOU'RE THE GREATEST
BUT ONCE YOU TURN THEY HATE US

OH THE MISERY
EVERYBODY WANTS TO BE MY ENEMY
SPARE THE SYMPATHY
EVERYBODY WANTS TO BE
MY ENEMY

YOUR WORDS UP ON THE WALL
AS YOU'RE PRAYING FOR MY FALL
AND THE LAUGHTER IN THE HALLS
AND THE NAMES THAT I'VE BEEN CALLED

I STACK IT IN MY MIND
AND I'M WAITING FOR THE TIME
WHEN I SHOW YOU WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO BE WORDS SPIT IN A MIC

TELL YOU YOU'RE THE GREATEST
BUT ONCE YOU TURN THEY HATE US
